functions.  It outputs values to \c stream under control of a
format string passed in \c fmt.  The actual values to print are
passed as a variable argument list \c ap.</p>
<p>\c vfprintf returns the number of characters written to \c stream,
or \c EOF in case of an error.  Currently, this will only happen
if \c stream has not been opened with write intent.</p>
<p>The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not \c %), which are copied unchanged to the output
stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion
specification is introduced by the \c % character.  The arguments must
properly correspond (after type promotion) with the conversion
specifier.  After the \c %, the following appear in sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero or more of the following flags:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> \c # The value should be converted to an "alternate form".  For
c, d, i, s, and u conversions, this option has no effect.
For o conversions, the precision of the number is
increased to force the first character of the output
string to a zero (except if a zero value is printed with
an explicit precision of zero).  For x and X conversions,
a non-zero result has the string `0x' (or `0X' for X
conversions) prepended to it.</li>
<li> \c 0 (zero) Zero padding.  For all conversions, the converted
value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.
If a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i,
o, u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.</li>
<li> \c - A negative field width flag; the converted value is to be
left adjusted on the field boundary.  The converted value
is padded on the right with blanks, rather than on the
left with blanks or zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are
given.</li>
<li> ' ' (space) A blank should be left before a positive number
produced by a signed conversion (d, or i).</li>
<li> \c + A sign must always be placed before a number produced by a
signed conversion.  A + overrides a space if both are
used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width.
If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it
will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
flag has been given) to fill out the field width.</li>
<li>An optional precision, in the form of a period . followed by an
optional digit string.  If the digit string is omitted, the
precision is taken as zero.  This gives the minimum number of
digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, or the
maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for \c s
conversions.</li>
<li>An optional \c l or \c h length modifier, that specifies that the
argument for the d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion is a \c &quot;long int&quot;
rather than \c int. The \c h is ignored, as \c &quot;short int&quot; is
equivalent to \c int.</li>
<li>A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>\c diouxX The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted
to signed decimal (d and i), unsigned octal (o), unsigned
decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.
The letters &quot;abcdef&quot; are used for x conversions; the
letters &quot;ABCDEF&quot; are used for X conversions.  The
precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that
must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits,
it is padded on the left with zeros.</li>
<li>\c p  The <tt>void *</tt> argument is taken as an unsigned integer,
and converted similarly as a <tt>%#x</tt> command would do.</li>
<li>\c c  The \c int argument is converted to an \c &quot;unsigned char&quot;, and the
resulting character is written.</li>
<li>\c s  The \c &quot;char *&quot; argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from
the array are written up to (but not including) a
terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no
more than the number specified are written.  If a precision
is given, no null character need be present; if the
precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of
the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL
character.</li>
<li>\c %  A \c % is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete
conversion specification is &quot;%%&quot;.</li>
<li>\c eE The double argument is rounded and converted in the format
\c &quot;[-]d.ddde�dd&quot; where there is one digit before the
decimal-point character and the number of digits after it
is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it
is taken as 6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point
character appears.  An \e E conversion uses the letter \c 'E'
(rather than \c 'e') to introduce the exponent.  The exponent
always contains two digits; if the value is zero,
the exponent is 00.</li>
<li>\c fF The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation
in the format \c &quot;[-]ddd.ddd&quot;, where the number of digits after the
decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification.
If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision
is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.  If a
decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.</li>
<li>\c gG The double argument is converted in style \c f or \c e (or
\c F or \c E for \c G conversions).  The precision
specifies the number of significant digits.  If the
precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision
is zero, it is treated as 1.  Style \c e is used if the
exponent from its conversion is less than -4 or greater
than or equal to the precision.  Trailing zeros are removed
from the fractional part of the result; a decimal point
appears only if it is followed by at least one digit.</li>
<li>\c S  Similar to the \c s format, except the pointer is expected to
point to a program-memory (ROM) string instead of a RAM string.</li>
</ul>
<p>In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.</p>
<p>Since the full implementation of all the mentioned features becomes
fairly large, three different flavours of vfprintf() can be
selected using linker options.  The default vfprintf() implements
all the mentioned functionality except floating point conversions.
A minimized version of vfprintf() is available that only implements
the very basic integer and string conversion facilities, but only
the \c # additional option can be specified using conversion
flags (these flags are parsed correctly from the format
specification, but then simply ignored).  This version can be
requested using the following \ref gcc_minusW &quot;compiler options&quot;:</p>
<p>\code
-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_min
\endcode</p>
<p>If the full functionality including the floating point conversions
is required, the following options should be used:</p>
<p>\code
-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm
\endcode</p>
<p>\par Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specified width and precision can be at most 255.</li>
</ul>
<p>\par Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For floating-point conversions, if you link default or minimized
version of vfprintf(), the symbol \c ? will be output and double
argument will be skipped. So you output below will not be crashed.
For default version the width field and the &quot;pad to left&quot; ( symbol
minus ) option will work in this case.</li>
<li>The \c hh length modifier is ignored (\c char argument is
promouted to \c int). More exactly, this realization does not check
the number of \c h symbols.</li>
<li>But the \c ll length modifier will to abort the output, as this
realization does not operate \c long \c long arguments.</li>
<li>The variable width or precision field (an asterisk \c * symbol)
is not realized and will to abort the output.</li>
</ul>
